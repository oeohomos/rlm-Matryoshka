The sky is blue.
The grass is green.
The sun is yellow.
The rose is red.
The ocean is blue.
The leaves are green.
The fire is red and orange.
The clouds are white.
The night sky is black.
The blue bird flew over the green meadow.
A red car drove past the blue house.
The green frog sat on a red lily pad.
Blue and red make purple.
Yellow and blue make green.
Red, blue, and green are primary colors for light.
The blue whale is the largest animal.
Green forests cover the mountains.
Red apples hang from the tree.
The blue sky meets the green horizon.
White snow covered the red barn.
